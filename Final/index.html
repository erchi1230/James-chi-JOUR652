      <h2 id="subline">UMD students foster future guide dogs</h2>

      <h4 id="byline">By James Chi</h4>

      <p class="paragraphs">A group of people with small puppies just appeared at the IKEA College Park and started to strolling around inside the shopping area. Puppies walked pass aisles and stairs, following their owners to all kinds of places. One lady even waved a stuffed dog to in front of them, trying to distract their attention.</p>

      <br>

      <p class="paragraphs">It turns out that they are guide dog puppies that are trained and fostered by the organization Terps Raising Pups, the student chapter of the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind (GDF) at the University of Maryland. The foundation, founded for more than 70 years, has been dedicated to breed, raise, train, and place assistance dogs without charging any fee. As the GDF’s second-biggest college program, Terps Raising Pups handles more than 20 pups on campus and has been expanding rapidly as more students joining as puppy raisers.</p>

      <h2 class="chapter_head">Get puppies ready for their next stage</h2>

      <p class="paragraphs">The purpose of the college puppy raising program is to equip puppies with the qualities of a good guide dog. “Basic obedience, exposure to different environments, and (having) great house manners, that’s the three big things we go for.”. Melissa Smith, the area coordinator of the organization, explained their major goals. These three things are seen as an important foundation to become a qualified guide dog.</p>

      <h2 class="chapter_head">Immersive learning for both human and dogs</h2>

      <p class="paragraphs">Puppies learn things through immersing into human’s lives. They become a part of their raiser’s daily life, experiencing any activities or things that their human did during the day. To ensure that all puppies could be taking good care of, the organization will have two raisers collaborating on fostering one dog. With two people, both of the raisers will have more freedom in arranging their schedules. This could make sure that there is always at least one person stays with the dog, and also give the puppy more diverse experiences.</p>

      <br>

      <p class="paragraphs">However, puppy raisers also need to learn how to teach and what to teach their puppies. The Terps Raise Pup cooperates with GDF and provides training lessons for the raisers so that they can do their job properly.</p>

      </div>

      <h2 class="chapter_head">Time to go to class</h2>

      <p class="paragraphs">Around 30 training classes designed for puppy raisers to gather and practice training activities together. It usually holds at different places, even outside the campus (E.g. IKEA, Hotels, etc.). This is the place where the raiser can learn more about the training routines and clarify questions you encountered before. This is also an important opportunity for the organization to check on every puppy’s status.</p>

      <br>

      <p class="paragraphs">“In those training classes, we really tried to make sure that the raisers and the puppies are engaged to each other, and teach the raisers how to teach their puppies new things. Because we only see them for 5 hours a month, and since we only see them at those training classes, we really wanna make sure that the raisers know how to teach their puppies outside the classes.” Melissa stated.</p>

      <h2 class="chapter_head">Build bonds to human, not attachments to you</h2>

      <p class="paragraphs">The guide dog puppy raising is different from having a temporary pet dog. For them, it is very important for them to be able to follow the command from a different person. “(Puppies getting used to being handled by different people) That’s such a big thing and that’s something we try to do a lot…”, Melissa said about the importance for puppies to listen to other people.</p>

      <br>

      <p class="paragraphs">“It is great that if your puppy responses to you. But if they can’t listen to somebody else, when they go back to the foundation and have to work with the trainer they have never met before, they need to be able to not have that attachment to you.”, Melissa said.</p>

      <h2 class="chapter_head">Future plans and challenges</h2>

      <p class="paragraphs">Though we appreciate the cuteness of the puppies, having dogs in crowded places can still trigger some problems or difficulties. According to Melissa, some people still ignore the Don’t Pet sign on puppies’ yellow vest and try to play with them. This could interfere with the training of the guide dog.</p>

      <br>

      <p class="paragraphs">Also, though the Guide Dog Foundation won’t charge the user, upbringing guide dogs from entirely and place them on the field still cost a lot. Helping the GDF to raise more funds is also one of the goals here in UMD campus.</p>

      <br>

      <p class="paragraphs">Maybe Next time when you see the yellow vest puppies again, give your distance blessing and try to make a contribution to other people’s efforts in helping people.</p>
